# 0.1.4-fork.2 release and installed acceptance

- Feature/source PR [#6](https://github.com/chenhaoxiang/rpiv-ask-user-question/pull/6) merged normally at `106ad6fd0ead85c608970f4424b7edcf1fc24901`; exact-head independent codex-local/deepseek-flash:high initial/fix review records and hashes are in that PR. Original findings remain preserved; all P0/P1 resolved. AI engineering review is not a second human approval.
- Local merged-source provider-free suite: **17/17 pass**. Exact-main hosted CI [38507872480](https://github.com/chenhaoxiang/rpiv-ask-user-question/actions/runs/38507872480) succeeded. Fixtures use synthetic models/empty auth, not personal credentials/history. Compaction alone additionally has strict OpenSpec and 92/92 measured added runtime lines; no branch metric or legacy strict-tsc success is asserted.
- Immutable [Release v0.1.4-fork.2](https://github.com/chenhaoxiang/rpiv-ask-user-question/releases/tag/v0.1.4-fork.2) is built from that exact clean source with tarball, release-manifest.json and SHA256SUMS. Fresh download verified both checksum entries and passed current Pi1.2.0-fork.1 isolated package/RPC loading. Package SHA256: `bcf18f34604b074df9e76bfa648a55b6fa3cf124ad87d1328da744b5f9938201`. Earlier scratch packs/logs are not release provenance.
- Installed permanent path: `/Users/robotmac/.pi/agent/packages/rpiv-ask-user-question/0.1.4-fork.2`. All **9 shipped files** read back byte-for-byte against the downloaded package; the source-bound manifest is retained beside them. Installed-path RPC loading passed without a model prompt.
- Exactly four package source declarations (Notify, Ask, Todo, Compaction) changed together; unrelated settings structurally unchanged, old fixed installations/Git caches preserved, forced restarts **0**. An isolated normal DefaultResourceLoader/fresh AgentSession on installed Pi1.2 loaded four packages with zero load errors/messages/model calls and exposed todo/ask_user_question. This does not exhaust every ambient extension or prove old sessions hot-loaded.
- Owner-only rollback snapshot/receipt: `~/.pi/agent/backups/four-extension-optimization-20261014/`. Rollback not exercised; not a promise that opaque-dependent sessions can safely downgrade. Finish current work before restarting to adopt installed code; never force-unload compaction while relying on an opaque checkpoint.
- No real provider compaction/billing or macOS notification/sound/terminal/IME acceptance performed. Readiness is observation, not business success, authorization or a complete bill. Source, merge, Release, installed bytes and running-session activation are separate facts. This docs-only handoff does not alter or republish immutable assets.
